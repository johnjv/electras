floor:
	repair belt sound to remove silence at end
	puncher doesn't go far enough

tutorial:
	initial locations of highlights seems off

clipboard:
	initial title screen
	maybe bigger font? (split levels across three screens?)
	implement language switch button
	repair page sound to remove silence at end
	clicking even in letterbox should hide the clipboard

circuit:
	tap anywhere on switch should toggle it - drag anywhere should move it
	initial error message when creating Workshop object
	when minimized, resizing window should lead to moving circuit
