floor:
	repair belt sound to remove silence at end
	puncher doesn't go far enough

tutorial:
	initial locations of highlights seems off

clipboard:
	initial title screen
	maybe bigger font? (split levels across three screens?)
	rearrange buttons to be all on bottom
	enable buttons: levels, language, sound on/off
	whether hint revealed should be remembered
	credits page does not work
	add checks when correct
	repair page sound to remove silence at end
	fade buttons when inapplicable (next, hint, prev, credits, contents)

circuit:
	when minimized, resizing window should lead to moving circuit
