<h1>Sonnet 1</h1>

<p>From fairest creatures we desire increase, <br />
That thereby beauty's rose might never die, <br />
But as the riper should by time decease, <br />
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
Making a famine where abundance lies, <br />
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br />
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament <br />
And only herald to the gaudy spring, <br />
Within thine own bud buriest thy content <br />
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</p>

<h1>Sonnet 2</h1>

<p>When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, <br />
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, <br />
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: <br />
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies, <br />
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, <br />
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes, <br />
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.<br />
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, <br />
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine <br />
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,' <br />
Proving his beauty by succession thine! <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This were to be new made when thou art old, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</p>

<h1>Sonnet 3</h1>

<p>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest <br />
Now is the time that face should form another; <br />
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, <br />
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother,<br />
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb <br />
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? <br />
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb <br />
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? <br />
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<br />
Calls back the lovely April of her prime: <br />
So thou through windows of thine age shall see<br />
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if thou live, remember'd not to be, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</p>
